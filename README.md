# Election-analysis

## Overview of Election Analysis

   The purpose of the analyisis is to do an audit of a recent election and using ptyhon code porvide the results of that audit. After doing our research we will be able to provide the results of the election, the total of votes for each candidagte, which candidate got the most votes and the percentage he/she got of the total vote. 
   We will also be able to determine the number of votes for each county so we can tell which one had the largest turnout.
   
 ## Election-Audit Results
 
    After running our code (https://github.com/gotica462/Election-analysis/blob/main/PyPoll_Challenge.py) we were able to obtain the results the election and we can determine:
    
    - There were 369,711 votes casted in the election
    - There were 38,855 votes counted in the county of Jefferson for a 10.5 % of the total vote
    - There were 306,055 votes counted in the county of Denver for a 82.8 % of the total vote
    - There were 24,801 votes counted in the county of Arapahoe for a 6.7 % of the total vote
    - Charles Casper Stockham got a total of 85,213 votes that represent 23.0% of the total vote
    - Diana DeGette got a total of 272,892 votes that represent 73.8% of the total vote
    - Raymon Anthony Doane got a total of 11,606 votes that represent 3.1% of the total vote.

   To Summarize:
    
    The winner of the election was Diana DeGette with a total of 272,892 for a 73.8% of the total vote, and the county of Denver had the most turnout of votes.
    
    
  ## Election-Audit Summary
  
  Using this code we could do an audit of other elections, we would only have to import the new file, we could also use this code to audit an election in a larger scale. We could also use this code to determine the turnaroung of each county only adding the total voters registered in each county, so for example I could say that the turnaround in Denver was more than 75 percent. We could also add other variables to the data base if we want to do a deeper analyisis
  We could also use a code to see the percentage that each candidate got in each county. In a practical sense, this could help the candidates allocate their resources accordingly.
